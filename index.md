### OBJECTIVE
Create and deploy fully decentralized end to end  DAPP



## OVERVIEW
Inspired by the current presidential elections our project seeks to provide an alternative to the traditional methods of voting in a presidential election. 
We wanted to highlight how blockchain technology could ensure strict compliance with the principles of democratic elections.
1. Freedom to vote.
A dapp can expand voting access
2. Secrecy of vote.*
3. Non-modification of the votes cast.
Blockchain data is immutable
4. Lack of intimidation during elections.

            * Since transactions are not truly secret in the Ethereum blockchain more robust alternatives like Quorum are needed.

Some of the current challenges of paper-based/ traditional voting:
---Human error handling paper ballots.
---Ease of manipulation.
---COVID-19 has limited in person voting.
