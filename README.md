### OBJECTIVE

Our objective was to develop end-to-end  decentralized application.
Set up an Ethereum network private blockchainusing AWS.
Compiling and deploying a solidity smartcontract in the private environment.
Use IFPS storage to store candidatesâ€™ profiles information.
Interacting with the contract on the blockchain using Metamask.
Interact with the contract through a web pageto allow for voting and display important vote information.

## OVERVIEW
Inspired by the current presidential elections our project seeks to provide an alternative to the traditional methods of voting in a presidential election. 
We wanted to highlight how blockchain technology could ensure strict compliance with the principles of democratic elections.
1. Freedom to vote.
A dapp can expand voting access
2. Secrecy of vote.*
3. Non-modification of the votes cast.
Blockchain data is immutable
4. Lack of intimidation during elections.
        *Since transactions are not truly secret in the Ethereum blockchain more robust alternatives like Quorum are needed.

Some of the current challenges of paper-based/ traditional voting:
1. Human error handling paper ballots.
2. Ease of manipulation.
3. COVID-19 has limited in person voting.
